        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Debugging is a universal part of software development, but it doesn't have to be a frustrating one. Our mission is to transform the debugging process from a chore into a learning opportunity. We created the AI Debugger to help developers of all levels reclaim their time, understand the root cause of errors, and write better code.</p>

        <h2>The Technology</h2>
        <p>This tool is more than just a search engine. It's powered by Google's advanced Gemini AI, which is trained to understand the context and nuances of programming code. When you submit an error, the AI acts as an expert software engineer, providing a level of analysis that goes far beyond simple pattern matching. It contextualizes the error, reasons about the cause, and formulates a comprehensive solution.</p>

        <h2>Our Commitment to Developers</h2>
        <p>We believe that great tools should be both powerful and trustworthy. We are committed to protecting your privacy by never storing the code you submit. Our goal is to provide a reliable assistant that not only fixes immediate problems but also helps you grow as a developer by explaining the "why" behind the fix. This tool is here to augment your skills, not replace them.</p>
